1
0:00:19.300000 --> 0:00:21.800000
My name is Max.

2
0:00:21.900000 --> 0:00:25.200000
My world is fire and blood.

3
0:00:25.300000 --> 0:00:26.800000
Why are you hurting these people?

4
0:00:26.900000 --> 0:00:29.300000
- It's the oil, stupid. - Oil wars.

5
0:00:29.400000 --> 0:00:31.400000
- We are killing for guzzoline. - Guzzoline.

6
0:00:31.500000 --> 0:00:33.300000
The world is actually running out of water.

7
0:00:33.400000 --> 0:00:36.600000
Now there's the water wars.

8
0:00:36.700000 --> 0:00:39.200000
Once, I was a cop,

9
0:00:39.300000 --> 0:00:42.200000
a road warrior searching for a righteous cause.

10
0:00:42.300000 --> 0:00:43.900000
...to the terminal freak-out point.

11
0:00:44 --> 0:00:47.100000
Mankind has gone rogue, terrorizing itself.

12
0:00:47.200000 --> 0:00:48.700000
Thermonuclear skirmish.

13
0:00:48.800000 --> 0:00:51.600000
- The earth is sour. - Our bones are poisoned.

14
0:00:51.700000 --> 0:00:54.800000
We have become half-life.

15
0:00:54.900000 --> 0:01:00.300000
As the world fell, each of us, in our own way, was broken.

16
0:01:00.400000 --> 0:01:03.400000
It was hard to know who was more crazy...

17
0:01:05.500000 --> 0:01:09.300000
me or everyone else.

18
0:01:11.700000 --> 0:01:14
Hello?

19
0:01:15.300000 --> 0:01:17.300000
Where are you?

20
0:01:24.100000 --> 0:01:25.200000
Where are you, Max?

21
0:01:25.300000 --> 0:01:27.600000
- Here they come again. - Max Rockatansky.

22
0:01:27.700000 --> 0:01:31.100000
Worming their way into the black matter of my brain.

23
0:01:31.200000 --> 0:01:34
- Help us, Max. - You promised to help us.

24
0:01:37.500000 --> 0:01:41.700000
I tell myself... they cannot touch me.

25
0:01:43.500000 --> 0:01:45.900000
They are long dead.

26
0:02:17 --> 0:02:19.300000
After him!

27
0:02:20.800000 --> 0:02:23.100000
After him!

28
0:02:27.300000 --> 0:02:29.100000
Now!

29
0:02:43.300000 --> 0:02:48.500000
I am the one who runs from both the living and the dead,

30
0:02:48.600000 --> 0:02:51.700000
hunted by scavengers,

31
0:02:51.800000 --> 0:02:54.600000
haunted by those I could not protect.

32
0:03:04.100000 --> 0:03:07.500000
So I exist in this wasteland.

33
0:03:11.500000 --> 0:03:16.200000
A man reduced to a single instinct...

34
0:03:16.300000 --> 0:03:18.500000
survive.

35
0:04:37.900000 --> 0:04:42
Max? Is that you? Where were you?

36
0:04:44.300000 --> 0:04:47.800000
Help us. Where were you? Help us, Max. Where were you, Max?

37
0:05:04.100000 --> 0:05:06.900000
Stop running, Max. Stop running.

38
0:05:07.300000 --> 0:05:08.900000
You let us die.

39
0:05:10 --> 0:05:11.400000
You let us die!

40
0:05:11.500000 --> 0:05:13.200000
You let us die!

41
0:05:13.300000 --> 0:05:15.100000
You promised to help us.

42
0:05:34.800000 --> 0:05:37.300000
Witness!

43
0:06:29.100000 --> 0:06:32.100000
- We are War Boys! - War Boys!

44
0:06:32.200000 --> 0:06:35.300000
- Kamakrazee War Boys! - War Boys!

45
0:06:35.400000 --> 0:06:39.100000
Fucacima Kamakrazee War Boys!

46
0:06:39.200000 --> 0:06:41.200000
Hooked on!

47
0:06:42.100000 --> 0:06:46
- Today we're headin' to Gas Town! - Gas Town!

48
0:06:46.100000 --> 0:06:50.400000
- Today we're haulin' Aqua Cola. - Aqua cola!

49
0:06:50.700000 --> 0:06:53.900000
- Today we're haulin' produce! - Produce!

50
0:06:54 --> 0:06:56.600000
And today we're haulin' mother's milk!

51
0:06:56.700000 --> 0:06:59.200000
Mother's milk!

52
0:07:47.200000 --> 0:07:51.400000
Rev it up for the Immortan Joe!

53
0:07:58.700000 --> 0:08:01.900000
Once again, we send off my war rig

54
0:08:02 --> 0:08:05.300000
to bring back guzzoline from Gas Town

55
0:08:05.400000 --> 0:08:08.400000
and bullets from The Bullet Farm.

56
0:08:08.800000 --> 0:08:14.400000
Once again, I salute my imperator, Furiosa!

57
0:08:14.600000 --> 0:08:18.600000
And I salute my half-life War Boys

58
0:08:18.700000 --> 0:08:21.200000
who will ride with me eternal

59
0:08:21.300000 --> 0:08:25.300000
on the highways of Valhalla.

60
0:08:26.300000 --> 0:08:29.100000
I am your redeemer!

61
0:08:29.300000 --> 0:08:31.900000
It is by my hand

62
0:08:32 --> 0:08:37.200000
you will rise from the ashes of this world!

63
0:08:44.700000 --> 0:08:47
It's comin'. Get ready.

64
0:08:47.100000 --> 0:08:51.500000
Yes. Yes. Yes. It's comin'.

65
0:09:47.700000 --> 0:09:52.300000
Do not, my friends, become addicted to water.

66
0:09:52.400000 --> 0:09:58.100000
It will take hold of you. And you will resent its absence.

67
0:10:22 --> 0:10:24.500000
Get 'em all off!

68
0:10:25.200000 --> 0:10:27.100000
Get 'em all off!

69
0:10:27.800000 --> 0:10:29.800000
Clear off!

70
0:10:38.300000 --> 0:10:41.300000
Signal Gas Town. Convoy's on its way.

71
0:11:07.900000 --> 0:11:10.800000
I got a War Boy runnin' on empty.

72
0:11:10.900000 --> 0:11:13.500000
Hook up that full-life.

73
0:11:16.900000 --> 0:11:19.600000
Careful. That's a universal donor.

74
0:12:16.500000 --> 0:12:19.100000
Boss, we're not going to Gas Town?

75
0:12:21 --> 0:12:23.400000
Bullet Farm?

76
0:12:24.900000 --> 0:12:27.200000
We're heading east.

77
0:12:28.300000 --> 0:12:30.700000
I'll pass it down the line.

78
0:12:31.200000 --> 0:12:34.300000
New orders! Thunder up! Thunder up!

79
0:12:34.800000 --> 0:12:36.600000
This is not a supply run!

80
0:12:37 --> 0:12:39.700000
- Go. Go. Go. - Ace, what's going on?

81
0:12:39.800000 --> 0:12:41.100000
- We're heading east. - Why?

82
0:12:41.200000 --> 0:12:43.800000
I don't know. That's the order.

83
0:13:01.300000 --> 0:13:02.200000
Moo.

84
0:13:02.300000 --> 0:13:05.800000
Hey, pa. You know about this?

85
0:13:05.900000 --> 0:13:09.100000
Your produce ain't going to Gas Town.

86
0:13:18.300000 --> 0:13:22.700000
She's gone off-road... into hostile territory.

87
0:13:24.600000 --> 0:13:27
Why would she do that, Dad?

88
0:13:28.100000 --> 0:13:30.400000
- Let me see. Let me see. I wanna see! - Rictus.

89
0:13:30.500000 --> 0:13:34.600000
Rictus, go see what's agitating Dad!

90
0:14:01.800000 --> 0:14:04.300000
Splendid!

91
0:14:04.400000 --> 0:14:06.100000
Angharad!

92
0:14:15.700000 --> 0:14:16.900000
Where are they?

93
0:14:17 --> 0:14:18.900000
They are not your property.

94
0:14:19 --> 0:14:22.700000
- Miss Giddy? - You cannot own a human being.

95
0:14:22.800000 --> 0:14:25.100000
Sooner or later someone pushes back!

96
0:14:25.300000 --> 0:14:27.600000
Where is she taking them?!

97
0:14:27.700000 --> 0:14:30.500000
She didn't take them. They begged her to go.

98
0:14:32 --> 0:14:35.600000
- Where is she taking them? - A long way from you.

99
0:15:01.700000 --> 0:15:03.900000
Hey, what's happening?

100
0:15:05.300000 --> 0:15:08.700000
Slit. What's going on? Slit!

101
0:15:08.800000 --> 0:15:11.600000
Treason, betrayal, an imperator gone rogue.

102
0:15:11.700000 --> 0:15:13.200000
An imperator. Who?

103
0:15:13.300000 --> 0:15:16.400000
Furiosa. She took a lot of stuff from Immortan Joe.

104
0:15:16.500000 --> 0:15:19.800000
- What stuff? - Breeders. His prize breeders.

105
0:15:19.900000 --> 0:15:22.500000
He wants them back. Not a hand laid on 'em.

106
0:15:29.500000 --> 0:15:32.700000
By my deeds, I honor him. V-8.

107
0:15:44.800000 --> 0:15:46.700000
- That's my wheel. - I'm driving.

108
0:15:46.800000 --> 0:15:49.500000
- You're my lancer. - I just promoted myself.

109
0:15:49.600000 --> 0:15:52.300000
- Not today. Today is my day. - Look at you!

110
0:15:52.400000 --> 0:15:54.400000
If you can't stand up, you can't do war!

111
0:15:54.500000 --> 0:15:58
- He's right, son. - I'm not staying here dying soft.

112
0:15:58.100000 --> 0:16:00.300000
You're already a corpse.

113
0:16:00.400000 --> 0:16:03.100000
- I just need a top-up, some more juice. - There's no time!

114
0:16:03.200000 --> 0:16:06.700000
We take my blood bag. We take my blood bag and strap him to the lancer's perch.

115
0:16:06.800000 --> 0:16:08.800000
It's got a muzzle on it. It's a raging feral.

116
0:16:08.900000 --> 0:16:11.700000
That's right. High-octane crazy blood fillin' me up.

117
0:16:16.900000 --> 0:16:18.900000
If I'm gonna die...

118
0:16:19.300000 --> 0:16:21.100000
I'm gonna die historic on the fury road.

119
0:16:27.700000 --> 0:16:31.800000
- Yeah. Yeah. Organic. - Yeah?

120
0:16:31.900000 --> 0:16:34.400000
- Hitch up his blood bag. - Right-o.

121
0:16:42.300000 --> 0:16:43.300000
Yeah!

122
0:16:44.600000 --> 0:16:49.100000
How much more can they take from me? They've got my blood. Now it's my car!

123
0:17:26.900000 --> 0:17:28.700000
Immortan!

124
0:17:29.100000 --> 0:17:31.600000
Immortan Joe!

125
0:17:33.500000 --> 0:17:34.900000
He looked at me!

126
0:17:35.700000 --> 0:17:38.500000
- He looked right at me! - He looked at your blood bag!

127
0:17:38.600000 --> 0:17:41
He turned his head. He looked me straight in the eye.

128
0:17:41.200000 --> 0:17:43.400000
He was scanning the horizon.

129
0:17:43.900000 --> 0:17:46.800000
No. I am awaited.

130
0:17:46.900000 --> 0:17:49
I am awaited in Valhalla!

131
0:17:51.600000 --> 0:17:53.500000
Confucamus!

132
0:17:55.900000 --> 0:17:58.400000
Immortan!

133
0:17:58.500000 --> 0:18:00.500000
Yeah!

134
0:18:19.300000 --> 0:18:22.200000
- Hey! Heads up! - Heads up!

135
0:18:27.200000 --> 0:18:29.200000
Boss!

136
0:18:29.300000 --> 0:18:32.100000
We got vehicles from The Citadel. They're firing flares.

137
0:18:32.200000 --> 0:18:35.400000
They want reinforcements from Gas Town and The Bullet Farm.

138
0:18:35.500000 --> 0:18:37.800000
What is this? Backup? Decoy?

139
0:18:39.200000 --> 0:18:40.700000
It's a detour.

140
0:19:13 --> 0:19:15.200000
Eyes right.

141
0:19:17.300000 --> 0:19:20.700000
Buzzards! Buzzards right! Eyes on! Eyes on!

142
0:19:20.800000 --> 0:19:22.800000
Buzzards right! Eyes on!

143
0:19:23.300000 --> 0:19:24.300000
Yeah!

144
0:19:25.700000 --> 0:19:29.300000
Should we turn it 'round and run 'em into our backup?

145
0:19:30.400000 --> 0:19:32.800000
No. We're good.

146
0:19:32.900000 --> 0:19:34.800000
We fang it!

147
0:19:37.600000 --> 0:19:40.400000
Thunder up! Here we go!

148
0:19:42.700000 --> 0:19:44.400000
Prepare the gunners!

149
0:20:13.500000 --> 0:20:15.800000
Morsov!

150
0:20:18.200000 --> 0:20:20.400000
Come on, attack!

151
0:20:32 --> 0:20:34.100000
War!

152
0:20:41.500000 --> 0:20:42.800000
Ready!

153
0:21:26.900000 --> 0:21:29.400000
She's ours, Slit! She's ours.

154
0:21:29.500000 --> 0:21:32.300000
First, we get the buzzards off her back!

155
0:21:38 --> 0:21:40.300000
Form up!

156
0:21:43.200000 --> 0:21:45.400000
That's my head!

157
0:22:19.500000 --> 0:22:21.900000
Get up! You can do it!

158
0:22:26.700000 --> 0:22:27.800000
Morsov!

159
0:22:29.300000 --> 0:22:31.600000
- Morsov! - No!

160
0:22:31.700000 --> 0:22:35.800000
- Witness me! - Witness!

161
0:22:45.900000 --> 0:22:47.400000
Witness!

162
0:22:49 --> 0:22:53.400000
Mediocre, Morsov! Mediocre!

163
0:23:12.400000 --> 0:23:14.100000
Ready!

164
0:23:23.800000 --> 0:23:25
Get ready!

165
0:23:27 --> 0:23:28.900000
Back me in!

166
0:23:31.800000 --> 0:23:33.200000
They're coming!

167
0:23:51 --> 0:23:54.200000
- We can't breathe down there! - Stay out of sight!

168
0:23:55.300000 --> 0:23:56.400000
Now!

169
0:24:08.300000 --> 0:24:09.700000
Go back!

170
0:24:12 --> 0:24:14
Hydraulics! Hydraulics!

171
0:24:35.900000 --> 0:24:37.800000
Yeah.

172
0:24:42.100000 --> 0:24:44.900000
Now we bring home the Booty.

173
0:25:10.700000 --> 0:25:12.700000
She thinks she can lose us, Dad.

174
0:25:13 --> 0:25:17.500000
She thinks we're stupid. She thinks she can lose us in there!

175
0:25:36.300000 --> 0:25:39
Fang it! Fang it!

176
0:25:45.400000 --> 0:25:47.200000
Why can't you stop?

177
0:25:47.700000 --> 0:25:50.100000
Crew! Outta the way! Out of the way!

178
0:25:50.200000 --> 0:25:52.900000
What have you done? What have you done?!

179
0:26:15.100000 --> 0:26:18.200000
We need counterweight. Get the blood bag down the back.

180
0:26:28.300000 --> 0:26:31.500000
Hunt them down! Hunt them down!

181
0:26:56.500000 --> 0:26:58.800000
Hey, head... say bye-bye to the neck!

182
0:26:58.900000 --> 0:27:01.500000
- Decapito! - We're goin' in, Slit!

183
0:28:03.700000 --> 0:28:06.300000
Come on! We've almost got her!

184
0:28:14.900000 --> 0:28:17.500000
Come on! Hold it steady!

185
0:28:44.800000 --> 0:28:47.300000
Oh, what a day! What a lovely day!

186
0:29:07.100000 --> 0:29:10.100000
I am the man... who grabs the sun...

187
0:29:12.900000 --> 0:29:16.300000
riding to Valhalla!

188
0:29:17.600000 --> 0:29:19.900000
Witness me, blood bag!

189
0:29:23.400000 --> 0:29:25.700000
Witness!

190
0:29:48.800000 --> 0:29:51
I live, I die, I live again!

191
0:33:34 --> 0:33:36.600000
We're not going back.

192
0:34:04.600000 --> 0:34:06.500000
Water.

193
0:35:01.400000 --> 0:35:03.400000
You.

194
0:35:17.200000 --> 0:35:22.400000
Angharad, is that just the wind, or is it a furious vexation?

195
0:36:51.900000 --> 0:36:53.300000
I got it!

196
0:37:34.500000 --> 0:37:37.500000
Glory me, blood bag! We snagged her alive.

197
0:37:37.600000 --> 0:37:40.300000
He's gonna shred her. Shred her!

198
0:37:40.400000 --> 0:37:42.100000
Bolt cutters.

199
0:37:42.200000 --> 0:37:44.100000
Chain.

200
0:37:45 --> 0:37:46.200000
Hey, hey!

201
0:37:49.700000 --> 0:37:51.400000
Oh, look at them.

202
0:37:52 --> 0:37:55.900000
So shiny, so chrome. He's gonna be so grateful.

203
0:37:57 --> 0:37:59.400000
We could ask for anything.

204
0:37:59.500000 --> 0:38:01.200000
I wanna drive the war rig.

205
0:38:02.400000 --> 0:38:04.500000
- What are you gonna ask for? - That's my jacket.

206
0:38:05.300000 --> 0:38:07.300000
Sure.

207
0:38:07.400000 --> 0:38:08.900000
I mean, you can ask for more than a jacket.

208
0:38:09 --> 0:38:10.400000
We're going to the Green Place.

209
0:38:10.500000 --> 0:38:12.200000
Wait, it's you and me.

210
0:38:25.900000 --> 0:38:28.900000
We're going to the Green Place of Many Mothers.

211
0:38:47 --> 0:38:48.800000
How does it feel?

212
0:38:48.900000 --> 0:38:52.700000
- It hurts. - Out here, everything hurts.

213
0:38:54 --> 0:38:55.500000
You wanna get through this?

214
0:38:59.300000 --> 0:39:01.600000
Do as I say.

215
0:39:05.300000 --> 0:39:08
Now pick up what you can and run.

216
0:39:50.100000 --> 0:39:51.500000
Kill switches.

217
0:39:53 --> 0:39:56.800000
I set the sequence myself. This rig goes nowhere without me.

218
0:40:00.800000 --> 0:40:02.400000
You can get in.

219
0:40:03.400000 --> 0:40:04.700000
Not without them.

220
0:40:13.200000 --> 0:40:15.700000
So we wait.

221
0:40:23.400000 --> 0:40:25.700000
You're relying on the gratitude of a very bad man.

222
0:40:26 --> 0:40:28.900000
You've already damaged one of his wives. How grateful do you think he's gonna be?

223
0:40:36.100000 --> 0:40:39.200000
You're sitting on 2,000 horsepower of nitro-boosted war machine.

224
0:40:40.200000 --> 0:40:43.300000
I'd say you've got about a five-minute head start.

225
0:40:50.900000 --> 0:40:53.800000
You want that thing off your face?

226
0:41:05.200000 --> 0:41:06.200000
Let's go.

227
0:41:50.700000 --> 0:41:54.300000
Of all the legs you had to shoot, that one was attached to his favorite.

228
0:42:15 --> 0:42:15.900000
Smeg!

229
0:42:36.300000 --> 0:42:38.100000
You don't have to do it just because he tells you.

230
0:42:38.200000 --> 0:42:40.900000
- What choice does she have? - He's not gonna hurt us. He needs us.

231
0:42:41 --> 0:42:42
- Why? - To bargain.

232
0:42:42.100000 --> 0:42:43.300000
Oh, he'll hurt us, all right.

233
0:42:43.400000 --> 0:42:45
Do you think he's coming to the Green Place?

234
0:42:45.100000 --> 0:42:48.100000
Never! He's a crazy smeg who eats schlanger!

235
0:43:15.200000 --> 0:43:17.300000
- Stay out of there. - Behind you.

236
0:43:22.100000 --> 0:43:23.500000
The Gas Town boys.

237
0:43:25.400000 --> 0:43:27.500000
Don't damage the goods.

238
0:43:33.800000 --> 0:43:35.100000
What do you see?

239
0:43:37.400000 --> 0:43:39.500000
Big Rigs.

240
0:43:40.600000 --> 0:43:42.700000
Polecats.

241
0:43:42.800000 --> 0:43:44.800000
Flamers.

242
0:43:45.700000 --> 0:43:48.200000
And there's the People Eater himself.

243
0:43:49.400000 --> 0:43:51.400000
Coming to count the cost.

244
0:44:07.500000 --> 0:44:11.100000
We're dragging something out back. I think it's the fuel pod.

245
0:44:12.100000 --> 0:44:14.300000
No, no.

246
0:44:14.700000 --> 0:44:16.600000
I'll go.

247
0:45:39.500000 --> 0:45:42.100000
Filth! You traited him!

248
0:45:45.800000 --> 0:45:46.900000
No unnecessary killing!

249
0:45:47 --> 0:45:49.700000
- This War Boy wants me dead! - We agreed!

250
0:45:49.800000 --> 0:45:51.500000
He's Kamakrazee!

251
0:45:52.100000 --> 0:45:54
He's just a kid at the end of his half-life.

252
0:45:54.300000 --> 0:45:56.900000
No! I live, I die, I live again!

253
0:45:57 --> 0:45:58.700000
- Hold him! - Tie him up!

254
0:45:58.800000 --> 0:46:00.300000
Throw him out!

255
0:46:00.400000 --> 0:46:02.200000
Chuck him out.

256
0:46:02.300000 --> 0:46:04.100000
You got more friends.

257
0:46:06.500000 --> 0:46:09.700000
Bullet Farmer. They're coming from The Bullet Farm.

258
0:46:09.800000 --> 0:46:11.300000
Yeah?

259
0:46:11.400000 --> 0:46:13.800000
It's over. You can't defy him.

260
0:46:13.900000 --> 0:46:15.900000
- Watch us, mate. - He is the one who grabbed the sun.

261
0:46:16 --> 0:46:17.900000
Look at how slick he's fooled you, War Boy!

262
0:46:18 --> 0:46:20.900000
- He's a lying old man. - By his hand, we'll be lifted up!

263
0:46:21 --> 0:46:23.500000
That's why we have his logo seared on our backs!

264
0:46:23.600000 --> 0:46:25.400000
"Breeding stock!" "Battle fodder!"

265
0:46:25.500000 --> 0:46:28.600000
- No, I am awaited! - You're an old man's battle fodder!

266
0:46:28.700000 --> 0:46:31.200000
- Killing everyone and everything! - We're not to blame!

267
0:46:31.300000 --> 0:46:33.400000
Then who killed the world?

268
0:47:01.100000 --> 0:47:03.700000
I made a deal up ahead. Safe passage.

269
0:47:03.800000 --> 0:47:06.100000
I don't know if it's still any good.

270
0:47:06.500000 --> 0:47:10.100000
Get back in the hold! Keep the hatch open.

271
0:47:16.500000 --> 0:47:18.600000
I need you here.

272
0:47:19.800000 --> 0:47:21.200000
You may have to drive the rig.

273
0:47:27.100000 --> 0:47:28.800000
You.

274
0:47:28.900000 --> 0:47:30.800000
You stay.

275
0:47:30.900000 --> 0:47:33
You stay there.

276
0:47:36 --> 0:47:38.200000
Whatever you do, you can't be seen.

277
0:47:38.500000 --> 0:47:42.100000
I'm supposed to be alone. That was the deal.

278
0:47:48.600000 --> 0:47:50.600000
Down here.

279
0:48:10.700000 --> 0:48:12.700000
Hey.

280
0:48:12.800000 --> 0:48:14.900000
What's your name?

281
0:48:15.900000 --> 0:48:18.200000
What do I call you?

282
0:48:18.300000 --> 0:48:20.600000
Does it matter?

283
0:48:21.800000 --> 0:48:23.400000
Fine.

284
0:48:23.500000 --> 0:48:26.900000
When I yell "fool," you drive out of here as fast as you can.

285
0:48:28.700000 --> 0:48:31.700000
This is the sequence... one.

286
0:48:31.800000 --> 0:48:34.300000
One, two. One.

287
0:48:34.400000 --> 0:48:36.800000
Red, black, go.

288
0:48:37.600000 --> 0:48:39.800000
You have it?

289
0:50:04.400000 --> 0:50:06.100000
It's all here!

290
0:50:07.100000 --> 0:50:10.100000
Three thousand gallons of guzzoline, just like you asked!

291
0:50:14 --> 0:50:15.700000
I'm gonna unhitch the pod.

292
0:50:17.800000 --> 0:50:20.500000
You drop the rocks.

293
0:50:27.900000 --> 0:50:32.800000
You said, "a few vehicles in pursuit. Maybe."

294
0:50:32.900000 --> 0:50:35.600000
We count three war parties!

295
0:50:36.200000 --> 0:50:39.700000
Yeah, well, I got unlucky. Let's do this!

296
0:51:06.300000 --> 0:51:07.500000
Fool!

297
0:51:48.400000 --> 0:51:51
That's our fuel!

298
0:52:04.500000 --> 0:52:07.300000
Make way for the ripsaw!

299
0:52:21.800000 --> 0:52:25.600000
Once I'm over, clear the rocks and bring everyone through.

300
0:52:25.700000 --> 0:52:28.900000
Immortan! Immortan Joe!

301
0:52:29 --> 0:52:32.700000
I got a War Boy! Says he was on the war rig!

302
0:52:34.800000 --> 0:52:37.700000
You! Climb aboard!

303
0:52:38.800000 --> 0:52:40.100000
Hey! Hey!

304
0:52:41.200000 --> 0:52:45.100000
I got his boot! I got the blood bag's boot!

305
0:52:45.200000 --> 0:52:48.900000
Take me! I got his boot!

306
0:52:50.500000 --> 0:52:52.900000
All this for a family squabble.

307
0:52:53.800000 --> 0:52:56
Healthy babies.

308
0:55:03.400000 --> 0:55:05.300000
Reload the clip.

309
0:55:05.400000 --> 0:55:07.900000
I can't.

310
0:55:13.700000 --> 0:55:15
Gun!

311
0:55:15.900000 --> 0:55:17.500000
- Give the gun! - It's not loaded yet!

312
0:55:17.600000 --> 0:55:20.100000
- You! We had a deal! - Now!

313
0:56:08.500000 --> 0:56:09.800000
Rictus!

314
0:56:10.200000 --> 0:56:12.800000
The wives! No more flames.

315
0:56:19.300000 --> 0:56:20.700000
Splendid!

316
0:56:21.200000 --> 0:56:26.100000
Splendid! That's my child! My property!

317
0:56:28.200000 --> 0:56:30.300000
Immorta...

318
0:56:38.800000 --> 0:56:42.700000
Immortan, if I get on the rig, there's a way inside.

319
0:56:42.800000 --> 0:56:45.300000
- What is your name? - It's Nux.

320
0:56:45.400000 --> 0:56:47.500000
I'll pike her in the spine. Keep her breathing for ya.

321
0:56:47.700000 --> 0:56:48.800000
No.

322
0:56:49 --> 0:56:53.600000
Put a bullet in her skull, stop the rig, return my treasures to me,

323
0:56:53.900000 --> 0:56:59.700000
and I myself will carry you to the gates of Valhalla.

324
0:57:00.100000 --> 0:57:02
Am I awaited?

325
0:57:02.100000 --> 0:57:06.800000
You will ride eternal... shiny and chrome.

326
0:57:07.700000 --> 0:57:09.400000
Rictus!

327
0:57:09.500000 --> 0:57:11.500000
Help him aboard!

328
0:57:12.800000 --> 0:57:14.500000
Ready?

329
0:57:14.600000 --> 0:57:16.700000
Here we go!

330
0:57:27.600000 --> 0:57:29.800000
Mediocre!

331
0:57:59.300000 --> 0:58:01.100000
Schlanger!

332
0:58:20.700000 --> 0:58:21.900000
Look out!

333
0:58:25 --> 0:58:28.400000
Angharad! Get out!

334
0:58:49.200000 --> 0:58:51.100000
- No! - Angharad!

335
0:59:05.700000 --> 0:59:08.200000
Stop! Turn the rig around!

336
0:59:09.100000 --> 0:59:11.200000
Go back for her!

337
0:59:12 --> 0:59:14.800000
- No. - Tell him to turn the rig around!

338
0:59:14.900000 --> 0:59:18.500000
- Did you see it? - She went under the wheels.

339
0:59:18.600000 --> 0:59:20.900000
Did you see it?

340
0:59:21.600000 --> 0:59:23.300000
She went under the wheels.

341
0:59:24.700000 --> 0:59:26.600000
- We keep moving. - No!

342
0:59:26.700000 --> 0:59:30.100000
- We keep moving! - He doesn't know what he's talking about!

343
0:59:30.200000 --> 0:59:32.200000
Whatever happens, we're going to the Green Place.

344
0:59:32.300000 --> 0:59:34.700000
The stupid Green Place. We don't even know where to find it.

345
0:59:47.500000 --> 0:59:50.500000
- You all right? - On! On!

346
1:00:28 --> 1:00:29
Cheedo!

347
1:00:29.700000 --> 1:00:31
Cheedo, don't be stupid.

348
1:00:31.200000 --> 1:00:33.800000
- Stop! - He'll forgive us. I know he will.

349
1:00:33.900000 --> 1:00:36.900000
- There is no going back! - We were his treasures!

350
1:00:37 --> 1:00:38.700000
- Cheedo! - We were protected.

351
1:00:38.800000 --> 1:00:40
He gave us the high life.

352
1:00:40.100000 --> 1:00:42.200000
- What's wrong with that? - We are not things.

353
1:00:43.400000 --> 1:00:45.300000
No!

354
1:00:45.800000 --> 1:00:48.500000
- Cheedo, we are not things! - We are not things.

355
1:00:48.600000 --> 1:00:51.400000
- I don't want to hear that again! - They were her words!

356
1:00:51.500000 --> 1:00:53.800000
And now she's dead!

357
1:00:54.100000 --> 1:00:55.300000
Wring your hands.

358
1:00:57.500000 --> 1:01:00.500000
- You're not going back to him. - Angharad!

359
1:01:00.600000 --> 1:01:03.100000
Come on! Come on!

360
1:01:19.800000 --> 1:01:22
So...

361
1:01:22.700000 --> 1:01:25
Where is this...

362
1:01:25.600000 --> 1:01:27.900000
This Green Place?

363
1:01:28.500000 --> 1:01:30.500000
It's a long night's run, heading east.

364
1:01:33 --> 1:01:37.500000
We need inventory. I want you to match every gun with its bullets.

365
1:01:40.800000 --> 1:01:42.400000
I'm gonna go down and do some repairs.

366
1:01:42.600000 --> 1:01:45
- We need someone down the back. - I'll go.

367
1:01:45.400000 --> 1:01:48.600000
No. I want you to stay together.

368
1:01:48.700000 --> 1:01:50.300000
I can do it.

369
1:02:23.100000 --> 1:02:25.500000
What are you doing here?

370
1:02:25.600000 --> 1:02:29.800000
He saw it. He saw it all.

371
1:02:30.400000 --> 1:02:34.300000
My own blood bag drivin' the rig that killed her.

372
1:02:40.700000 --> 1:02:43
Stop doing that.

373
1:02:45.500000 --> 1:02:46.400000
Stop.

374
1:02:56.500000 --> 1:02:59.400000
Thr... three times the gates were open to me.

375
1:02:59.900000 --> 1:03:01.400000
What gates?

376
1:03:01.500000 --> 1:03:05.700000
I was awaited in Valhalla. They were calling my name.

377
1:03:05.800000 --> 1:03:09.500000
I should be walking with the immorta, mcfeasting with the heroes of all time.

378
1:03:13 --> 1:03:16.500000
I'd say it was your manifest destiny not to.

379
1:03:17.900000 --> 1:03:20.700000
I thought I was being spared for something great.

380
1:03:20.800000 --> 1:03:25
I got to drive a pursuit vehicle.

381
1:03:25.100000 --> 1:03:28.400000
For a while even Larry and Barry stopped chewing on my windpipe.

382
1:03:28.500000 --> 1:03:30.200000
Who are Larry and Barry?

383
1:03:31.100000 --> 1:03:34.500000
My mates. Larry and Barry.

384
1:03:36.100000 --> 1:03:39.800000
If they don't get me, then the night fevers will.

385
1:04:03.400000 --> 1:04:08.500000
Well, we've only got four for big boy here, so he's all but useless.

386
1:04:08.600000 --> 1:04:15
But we can squirt off this little pinky a raunchy 29 times.

387
1:04:16.400000 --> 1:04:18.400000
Angharad used to call them antiseed.

388
1:04:19.500000 --> 1:04:22.800000
Plant one and watch something die.

389
1:05:56.900000 --> 1:06:00.100000
We are down 30,000 units of guzzoline,

390
1:06:00.200000 --> 1:06:04
19 canisters of nitro, 12 assault bikes,

391
1:06:04.100000 --> 1:06:07.100000
7 pursuit vehicles. The deficit mounts.

392
1:06:07.200000 --> 1:06:11.600000
And now, sir, you have us stuck in a quagmire.

393
1:06:12.200000 --> 1:06:13.600000
Hey, Joe!

394
1:06:14.300000 --> 1:06:15.600000
Boss!

395
1:06:17.500000 --> 1:06:20.200000
Your girly's breathing her last!

396
1:06:20.300000 --> 1:06:22.800000
What about the child?

397
1:06:31.400000 --> 1:06:34.900000
- Are ya comin', brother? - Wait!

398
1:06:35.300000 --> 1:06:40.500000
- It's gone awful quiet in there. - Get it out. Get it out!

399
1:06:42.700000 --> 1:06:44.800000
Come on! I've been called to the torture!

400
1:06:45.900000 --> 1:06:48.100000
Patience!

401
1:06:48.600000 --> 1:06:50.900000
Oh, you stay here with your grief, Daddy.

402
1:06:51.200000 --> 1:06:56
- I'll fetch 'em for ya. - Be careful! Protect the assets!

403
1:06:57 --> 1:06:59.700000
Just one angry shot...

404
1:06:59.800000 --> 1:07:01.700000
for Furiosa.

405
1:07:01.800000 --> 1:07:04
Hut!

406
1:07:10.300000 --> 1:07:12.700000
Cryin' shame.

407
1:07:13.100000 --> 1:07:14.900000
Come.

408
1:07:15.300000 --> 1:07:17
Nother month...

409
1:07:17.100000 --> 1:07:19.100000
Could've been your viable human.

410
1:07:19.200000 --> 1:07:22.200000
- Was it a male? - Your a-one Alpha prime.

411
1:07:25.400000 --> 1:07:27.700000
Hey, Rictus!

412
1:07:28.100000 --> 1:07:30.600000
You lost a baby brother.

413
1:07:32.300000 --> 1:07:35.100000
Perfect in every way.

414
1:07:36.900000 --> 1:07:41
I had a baby brother! I had a little baby brother!

415
1:07:41.100000 --> 1:07:45.900000
And he was perfect! Perfect in every way!

416
1:08:15.700000 --> 1:08:16.800000
Come on.

417
1:08:26.300000 --> 1:08:29.400000
- Wouldn't wanna shoot the wives, sir. - Just probing.

418
1:08:40.800000 --> 1:08:43.200000
- He wants to help! - Who?!

419
1:08:43.600000 --> 1:08:46
- The War Boy! - Where did he come from?!

420
1:08:46.100000 --> 1:08:49.100000
I thought we threw him off the rig!

421
1:08:52.700000 --> 1:08:54.700000
There's high ground just beyond that thing.

422
1:08:54.800000 --> 1:08:58.600000
- He means the tree. - Yeah. Tree!

423
1:08:59.400000 --> 1:09:01.900000
- Leave him to me. - Say, anyone notice that bright light?

424
1:09:02 --> 1:09:04.300000
Encroaching gunfire?

425
1:09:04.400000 --> 1:09:06.400000
- Get out. - I can do this. I know this machine.

426
1:09:06.500000 --> 1:09:08.200000
He does. He's a revhead.

427
1:09:13.800000 --> 1:09:16.400000
You've got two left.

428
1:09:21.300000 --> 1:09:23.200000
On him.

429
1:09:40 --> 1:09:42.100000
Don't breathe.

430
1:09:45.700000 --> 1:09:48.900000
Hey! Hey! Hey! War Boy!

431
1:09:49 --> 1:09:51.700000
I'm gonna use the winch 'round the tree thing!

432
1:09:52.700000 --> 1:09:55.900000
Take this. Let's get the engine plates.

433
1:09:57.100000 --> 1:09:58
You drive the rig!

434
1:09:58.300000 --> 1:10:00.800000
- Hold up a flare. - I am holding a flare!

435
1:10:00.900000 --> 1:10:04.200000
- Closer. - It's right in front of your eyes!

436
1:10:15.500000 --> 1:10:18.500000
Hut! Hut!

437
1:10:23.700000 --> 1:10:25.600000
Blood bag!

438
1:10:31.300000 --> 1:10:34
I am the scales of justice!

439
1:10:34.100000 --> 1:10:38.300000
Conductor of the choir of death!

440
1:10:41 --> 1:10:43.800000
Sing, brother koch!

441
1:10:45.600000 --> 1:10:49.100000
Sing, brothers, sing! Sing!

442
1:10:50.300000 --> 1:10:52.800000
Don't they know they're shooting at us?

443
1:11:06.300000 --> 1:11:08.600000
Gun fever!

444
1:12:18 --> 1:12:20.100000
I never thought I'd do something as shine as that.

445
1:12:20.700000 --> 1:12:22.800000
How are the engines?

446
1:12:22.900000 --> 1:12:25.500000
Very hot and real thirsty.

447
1:12:29.100000 --> 1:12:34.300000
Hey. You need to take the war rig half a click down the track.

448
1:12:34.400000 --> 1:12:38
What if you're not back by the time the engines have cooled?

449
1:12:39.500000 --> 1:12:42.300000
Well, you keep moving.

450
1:12:50.500000 --> 1:12:52.400000
What do you suppose he's gonna do?

451
1:12:53.500000 --> 1:12:56.100000
Retaliate first.

452
1:12:58.500000 --> 1:13:00.600000
Let's go!

453
1:14:19.600000 --> 1:14:22
Are you hurt?

454
1:14:22.400000 --> 1:14:25.700000
- You're bleeding. - That's not his blood.

455
1:14:27.600000 --> 1:14:29.500000
What is this?

456
1:14:29.800000 --> 1:14:32.400000
It's mother's milk.

457
1:15:13.500000 --> 1:15:15.800000
It's okay. Sleep.

458
1:15:17.100000 --> 1:15:19.300000
Get some rest.

459
1:15:29.100000 --> 1:15:32.200000
How do you know this place even exists?

460
1:15:34.300000 --> 1:15:35.800000
I was born there.

461
1:15:38.100000 --> 1:15:39.600000
So why'd you leave?

462
1:15:39.700000 --> 1:15:42.300000
I didn't.

463
1:15:42.400000 --> 1:15:44.200000
I was taken as a child.

464
1:15:46.100000 --> 1:15:47.500000
Stolen.

465
1:15:53.300000 --> 1:15:56.800000
- You done this before? - Many times.

466
1:15:58 --> 1:16:01.300000
Now that I drive a war rig...

467
1:16:01.900000 --> 1:16:03.900000
this is the best shot I'll ever have.

468
1:16:05.100000 --> 1:16:06.200000
And them?

469
1:16:08.100000 --> 1:16:10.800000
They're looking for hope.

470
1:16:10.900000 --> 1:16:13.500000
What about you?

471
1:16:17.700000 --> 1:16:19.800000
Redemption.

472
1:17:02.500000 --> 1:17:05.900000
Hey, what's that?

473
1:17:17.500000 --> 1:17:20.700000
I remember something like that.

474
1:17:31.700000 --> 1:17:34.300000
Help me!

475
1:17:36.400000 --> 1:17:39.200000
Help me!

476
1:17:41.700000 --> 1:17:44.300000
Help me, please!

477
1:17:45.200000 --> 1:17:47.400000
That's bait.

478
1:17:47.700000 --> 1:17:49
Stay in the rig.

479
1:17:54.300000 --> 1:17:58.100000
Hurry! Please, hurry! They'll be back!

480
1:17:58.700000 --> 1:18:01.800000
I am one of the Vuvalini!

481
1:18:01.900000 --> 1:18:04.500000
Of the Many Mothers!

482
1:18:05.300000 --> 1:18:09
My initiate mother was K.T. Concannon!

483
1:18:09.700000 --> 1:18:12.200000
I am the daughter of Mary Jabassa.

484
1:18:13.500000 --> 1:18:17.300000
My clan was Swaddle Dog!

485
1:19:03.600000 --> 1:19:04.800000
It's me.

486
1:19:13 --> 1:19:15.100000
There's something in the eyes.

487
1:19:15.200000 --> 1:19:17.600000
Perhaps it is Jabassa's child.

488
1:19:22.600000 --> 1:19:25.300000
This is our Furiosa.

489
1:19:26.900000 --> 1:19:28.100000
How long has it been?

490
1:19:29.900000 --> 1:19:34.600000
7,000 days. Plus the ones I don't remember.

491
1:19:35.400000 --> 1:19:37.500000
Furiosa.

492
1:19:37.800000 --> 1:19:40.800000
What happened to your mother?

493
1:19:40.900000 --> 1:19:42.800000
She died.

494
1:19:43.200000 --> 1:19:45.500000
On the third day.

495
1:19:51.800000 --> 1:19:55.700000
- From where did you come? - The west. Citadel.

496
1:19:55.800000 --> 1:19:58.100000
Beyond the mountains.

497
1:20:01.400000 --> 1:20:03.700000
The men... who are they?

498
1:20:03.800000 --> 1:20:07.800000
They're reliable. They helped us get here.

499
1:20:19.100000 --> 1:20:22.200000
Where did you find such creatures?

500
1:20:23.800000 --> 1:20:25.800000
So soft.

501
1:20:25.900000 --> 1:20:28.800000
This one has all her teeth.

502
1:20:36.400000 --> 1:20:39
I can't wait for them to see it.

503
1:20:39.100000 --> 1:20:41.100000
See?

504
1:20:41.200000 --> 1:20:44.900000
- See what? - Home.

505
1:20:48.200000 --> 1:20:49.900000
The Green Place.

506
1:20:50 --> 1:20:55.500000
But if you came from the west, you passed it.

507
1:20:55.900000 --> 1:21:00.800000
The crows. The creepy place with all the crows.

508
1:21:01.400000 --> 1:21:02.800000
- The soil. - We had to get out.

509
1:21:02.900000 --> 1:21:04.700000
- We had no water and... - The water was filth.

510
1:21:04.800000 --> 1:21:08.300000
- It was poisoned. It was sour. - And the crows came.

511
1:21:08.400000 --> 1:21:10.400000
We couldn't grow anything.

512
1:21:10.500000 --> 1:21:13
- Where are the others? - What others?

513
1:21:13.100000 --> 1:21:16.600000
- The Many Mothers. - We're the only ones left.

514
1:22:17.100000 --> 1:22:19
Look.

515
1:22:20.900000 --> 1:22:23.800000
That's what you call a satellite.

516
1:22:23.900000 --> 1:22:26.100000
Miss Giddy told us about those.

517
1:22:26.700000 --> 1:22:30.100000
They used to bounce messages across the earth.

518
1:22:30.200000 --> 1:22:34.400000
Shows. Everyone in the old world had a show.

519
1:22:36.800000 --> 1:22:39.700000
Do you think there's still somebody out there?

520
1:22:40.300000 --> 1:22:44.600000
- Sending shows? - Who knows.

521
1:22:44.700000 --> 1:22:47.700000
Those are the plains of silence.

522
1:22:49.600000 --> 1:22:54.100000
Stay right where you are, little Joe. Kind of lost its novelty out here.

523
1:22:54.200000 --> 1:22:56
You having a baby?

524
1:22:56.900000 --> 1:22:59.600000
Warlord Jr. Gonna be so ugly.

525
1:23:00.400000 --> 1:23:03
It could be a girl.

526
1:23:03.900000 --> 1:23:07.900000
- You kill people with that, do ya? - Killed everyone I ever met out here.

527
1:23:08 --> 1:23:10.600000
Headshots, all of 'em. Snap. Right in the medulla.

528
1:23:10.700000 --> 1:23:13.800000
Thought somehow you girls were above all that.

529
1:23:17.200000 --> 1:23:19.100000
Come here.

530
1:23:26.300000 --> 1:23:27.900000
Take a peek.

531
1:23:28 --> 1:23:30
Seeds.

532
1:23:30.200000 --> 1:23:34.100000
These are from home. Heirlooms. The real thing.

533
1:23:34.800000 --> 1:23:37.800000
- I plant one every chance I get. - Where?

534
1:23:38.300000 --> 1:23:41.700000
So far, nothing's took. Earth's too sour.

535
1:23:41.800000 --> 1:23:46.500000
- So many different kinds. - Trees, flowers, fruit.

536
1:23:46.600000 --> 1:23:48.600000
Back then, everyone had their fill.

537
1:23:49.500000 --> 1:23:52.900000
Back then, there was no need to snap anybody.

538
1:24:07.500000 --> 1:24:09.800000
Can I talk to you?

539
1:24:28.400000 --> 1:24:31.200000
I've talked with the others.

540
1:24:37 --> 1:24:41.300000
We're never gonna have a better chance to make it across the salt.

541
1:24:42.200000 --> 1:24:46.600000
If we leave the rig here and load the motorcycles up with as much as we can,

542
1:24:46.700000 --> 1:24:50.100000
we can maybe ride for 160 days.

543
1:24:51.900000 --> 1:24:54.900000
One of those bikes is yours.

544
1:24:55 --> 1:24:57.600000
Fully loaded.

545
1:24:59.400000 --> 1:25:02.200000
You're more than welcome to come with us.

546
1:25:05.800000 --> 1:25:08.600000
I'll... I'll make my own way.

547
1:25:14.200000 --> 1:25:17.400000
You know, hope is a mistake.

548
1:25:23.200000 --> 1:25:26.700000
If you can't fix what's broken, you'll...

549
1:25:28.500000 --> 1:25:30.900000
you'll go insane.

550
1:25:46.100000 --> 1:25:49.100000
Where are you, Max?

551
1:25:50 --> 1:25:52.500000
Where are you?

552
1:25:52.600000 --> 1:25:55.400000
- Help us. - You promised to help us.

553
1:26:05.400000 --> 1:26:08.600000
Come on, pa. Let's go.

554
1:26:39.500000 --> 1:26:41.600000
All right.

555
1:26:41.800000 --> 1:26:44.900000
This is your way home.

556
1:26:47.600000 --> 1:26:49.800000
We go back?

557
1:26:50.900000 --> 1:26:52.900000
- Back? - Yeah.

558
1:26:53 --> 1:26:56.200000
- I thought you weren't insane anymore. - What are they saying?

559
1:26:56.300000 --> 1:26:58.700000
He wants to go back from where they came.

560
1:26:58.800000 --> 1:27:01
The Citadel.

561
1:27:01.100000 --> 1:27:03
And what's there to find at The Citadel?

562
1:27:03.100000 --> 1:27:05.800000
- Green. - And water.

563
1:27:07.200000 --> 1:27:11
There's a ridiculous amount of clear water. And a lot of crops.

564
1:27:11.100000 --> 1:27:13.700000
It's got everything you need, as long as you're not afraid of heights.

565
1:27:13.800000 --> 1:27:16.500000
- Where does the water come from? - He pumps it up from deep in the earth.

566
1:27:16.600000 --> 1:27:18.900000
Calls it Aqua Cola and claims it all for himself.

567
1:27:19.300000 --> 1:27:21.500000
And because he owns it, he owns all of us.

568
1:27:21.600000 --> 1:27:23.100000
I don't like him already.

569
1:27:23.200000 --> 1:27:25.700000
It'll take two weeks to skirt the wall of mountains.

570
1:27:25.800000 --> 1:27:30.700000
No. I suggest we go back the same way we came.

571
1:27:31.200000 --> 1:27:33.700000
Through the canyon.

572
1:27:33.800000 --> 1:27:37.500000
It's open. We know that. Right? He brought all his war parties through.

573
1:27:38.200000 --> 1:27:41.700000
So we take the war rig and we charge it right through the middle of them.

574
1:27:41.800000 --> 1:27:44.700000
We can decouple the tanker at the pass.

575
1:27:44.800000 --> 1:27:47.500000
- Shut it off behind us. - Kaboom!

576
1:27:50.500000 --> 1:27:55.200000
And how exactly do we take The Citadel? Assuming we're still alive by then?

577
1:27:55.700000 --> 1:27:58.100000
If we can block the pass, it'll be easy.

578
1:27:58.400000 --> 1:28:02
All that's left are his war pups and War Boys too sick to fight.

579
1:28:02.900000 --> 1:28:06.500000
And we'll be with Nux. He's a War Boy.

580
1:28:06.600000 --> 1:28:09.200000
He'll be bringing us home, bringing back what's stolen, as he's meant to.

581
1:28:12.900000 --> 1:28:14.900000
Yeah.

582
1:28:15 --> 1:28:17
It feels like hope.

583
1:28:17.800000 --> 1:28:21.500000
I like this plan. We can start again.

584
1:28:21.600000 --> 1:28:24.400000
Just like the old days.

585
1:28:24.800000 --> 1:28:28.600000
Look, it'll be a hard day.

586
1:28:28.900000 --> 1:28:31.800000
But I guarantee you that 160 days ridin' that way,

587
1:28:34.400000 --> 1:28:36.300000
there's nothin' but salt.

588
1:28:38.900000 --> 1:28:42.700000
At least that way, you know, we might be able to...

589
1:28:43.300000 --> 1:28:45.300000
together...

590
1:28:46.100000 --> 1:28:47.900000
Come across some kind of redemption.

591
1:29:18.700000 --> 1:29:22.300000
War rig! That's the war rig!

592
1:29:32.200000 --> 1:29:35
- That's them. - Why are they going back?

593
1:29:35.400000 --> 1:29:38
Do they wish to surrender?

594
1:29:38.100000 --> 1:29:41.100000
They are heading for the canyon.

595
1:29:41.200000 --> 1:29:44.400000
They're going back to The Citadel!

596
1:29:44.500000 --> 1:29:48
- They know it's undefended! - Bullocks!

597
1:30:00.200000 --> 1:30:01.500000
Go!

598
1:30:23.900000 --> 1:30:25.600000
- What are you doing? - Praying.

599
1:30:25.700000 --> 1:30:28.800000
- To who? - Anyone that's listening.

600
1:30:52.700000 --> 1:30:55.400000
Here we go, girls!

601
1:30:56.300000 --> 1:30:58.100000
That's mine!

602
1:31:02 --> 1:31:04.700000
He'll try to get in front of us, spike our wheels.

603
1:31:11.300000 --> 1:31:12.900000
Don't blow my engine.

604
1:31:13 --> 1:31:15.800000
I'm gonna nudge him. Just a little.

605
1:31:28.200000 --> 1:31:31
You filth! You traitored him!

606
1:31:55 --> 1:31:56.900000
Go.

607
1:32:22.400000 --> 1:32:26.600000
Got to back off. Engine one is gone. Two's about to blow.

608
1:32:26.700000 --> 1:32:28.300000
Right.

609
1:32:28.400000 --> 1:32:30.100000
Are you a black thumb?

610
1:32:30.200000 --> 1:32:33.400000
All right. Engine one now. You and me, fifth wheel.

611
1:32:34.100000 --> 1:32:36.600000
We'll unhook the tanker.

612
1:32:47.900000 --> 1:32:50.500000
One man, one bullet.

613
1:33:06.500000 --> 1:33:08.200000
- I cannot see. - Maadi! Maadi!

614
1:33:08.300000 --> 1:33:10.600000
I cannot see.

615
1:33:49.100000 --> 1:33:53.800000
Hey! Harpoons and plows! They're hauling us back!

616
1:34:04.700000 --> 1:34:07.600000
Leave three bolts. Three.

617
1:35:25.100000 --> 1:35:27.100000
Hey, you!

618
1:35:42.100000 --> 1:35:44.400000
Are you okay?

619
1:35:46.200000 --> 1:35:48.800000
I think she's hurt.

620
1:36:11.600000 --> 1:36:12.700000
Hey!

621
1:36:38.600000 --> 1:36:40.300000
No!

622
1:36:49.400000 --> 1:36:52.400000
Hey. Stay with me.

623
1:36:52.500000 --> 1:36:54.300000
- Stay with me. - Stay with me.

624
1:36:54.400000 --> 1:36:56
Hey. Are you there?

625
1:36:57.200000 --> 1:36:59.800000
You finish that! I'll finish her!

626
1:38:29.600000 --> 1:38:31.500000
Valhalla!

627
1:38:42.900000 --> 1:38:44
Oi!

628
1:39:11.700000 --> 1:39:15.300000
Engine one's good. For now.

629
1:40:02.600000 --> 1:40:05.500000
She's hurt! She's hurt real bad!

630
1:41:35.800000 --> 1:41:39.100000
You hear that? We're gonna see two airborne V-8s.

631
1:41:40.600000 --> 1:41:43.200000
I'm gonna need you to drive.

632
1:41:44.500000 --> 1:41:46.700000
I'll get him out of our way.

633
1:42:53.300000 --> 1:42:55.600000
Rictus!

634
1:42:55.700000 --> 1:42:57.800000
Take me!

635
1:43:10 --> 1:43:12.900000
Cheedo! What are you doing?

636
1:43:17.200000 --> 1:43:18.700000
No!

637
1:43:22.900000 --> 1:43:24.900000
Big boy!

638
1:43:30.500000 --> 1:43:32.400000
Here! Here!

639
1:44:24.300000 --> 1:44:25.800000
No!

640
1:44:26.300000 --> 1:44:28.200000
Remember me?

641
1:44:48.900000 --> 1:44:51.900000
He's dead! He's dead.

642
1:45:10.800000 --> 1:45:14.500000
When you're across safe, I'll jam the throttle and follow you.

643
1:45:14.600000 --> 1:45:15.600000
Come on!

644
1:45:16.800000 --> 1:45:20.400000
Hurry! We're nearly at the pass.

645
1:46:06.900000 --> 1:46:09.500000
Witness me.

646
1:46:15 --> 1:46:17.500000
Rictus!

647
1:47:11.600000 --> 1:47:15.900000
- Why is she making that noise? - She's pumping air into her chest cavity.

648
1:47:16 --> 1:47:20
She's collapsing her lungs one breath at a time.

649
1:47:25.500000 --> 1:47:27.300000
I know.

650
1:47:29.600000 --> 1:47:32.100000
I am so sorry.

651
1:47:33.900000 --> 1:47:36.100000
I know. I know.

652
1:47:36.200000 --> 1:47:38.400000
Hold it there.

653
1:47:38.500000 --> 1:47:40
All right.

654
1:47:40.100000 --> 1:47:42.600000
Put that on there. Press it on.

655
1:47:42.700000 --> 1:47:46.400000
- Hey. Hey. - Home.

656
1:47:53.700000 --> 1:47:55.900000
Home.

657
1:48:00.700000 --> 1:48:02.300000
No. No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

658
1:48:02.400000 --> 1:48:05
She's exsanguinated. Drained all her blood.

659
1:48:06.800000 --> 1:48:08.500000
Hold these.

660
1:48:08.600000 --> 1:48:11.700000
We need that. Thank you. Needle.

661
1:48:12.700000 --> 1:48:14.600000
Come on!

662
1:48:15 --> 1:48:17.100000
Take this.

663
1:48:18.900000 --> 1:48:20.300000
Keep her awake.

664
1:48:20.400000 --> 1:48:21.600000
Furiosa.

665
1:48:25.400000 --> 1:48:28.100000
Okay, that's not retracting.

666
1:48:28.200000 --> 1:48:30.400000
There we go.

667
1:48:30.500000 --> 1:48:33.400000
All right, hold it up. Hold it up.

668
1:48:33.700000 --> 1:48:35.400000
Okay.

669
1:48:35.500000 --> 1:48:37.500000
Sorry.

670
1:48:38.300000 --> 1:48:41.300000
There you go. Okay. There you go.

671
1:48:53.400000 --> 1:48:54.700000
Max.

672
1:48:56 --> 1:48:58.500000
My name is Max.

673
1:49:06.100000 --> 1:49:08.700000
That's my name.

674
1:49:49.700000 --> 1:49:51.600000
Brake!

675
1:49:56.300000 --> 1:49:58.800000
Reveal yourself.

676
1:50:16.400000 --> 1:50:17.800000
He's got something.

677
1:50:24.500000 --> 1:50:26.100000
It's Immortan Joe.

678
1:50:26.200000 --> 1:50:29.200000
The Immortan Joe is dead!

679
1:50:55.300000 --> 1:50:57.500000
Furiosa!

680
1:51:01.700000 --> 1:51:02.900000
Furiosa!

681
1:51:03.300000 --> 1:51:05.700000
